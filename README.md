# dotfiles
Configuration files tweaked for personal usage. The goal of this project is to
easily maintain configuration files across multiple GNU/Linux systems. 

Ideally, the repository should be used with a program like GNU Stow. Splitting
up the configuration files and directories and using symlinks is the current
preferred way.
